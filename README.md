* Run the command: `pandoc -o readme.docx -f markdown -t docx README.md`

### Scriptax - Control Flow, Scoping, and Automation

#### Existing keys
* ct("\<someCommand\>") 
    * Commandtax execution
    * A command is executed during the parsing of the line and its response is returned
* set \<someVar\> = \<someValue\>
    * Sets a variable
    * Supports expressions, strings, numbers, booleans, dictionaries, lists, and commandtax responses
* "this is a string {{ someVar }}"
    * Injects the contents of a variable
    * Fancy stuff is possible such as: set newVar = ct("{{someVar}}")
* {{ r: someResponse }}
    * Injects the response of some request
* import ct("some commandtax")
    * Executes a command and imports the response to the current scope
* export ct("some commandtax"), export someVar 
    * Imports the values to the current scope and exports them to allow a parent scope to access these values 
* name \<someName\>
    * Sets the reference name of the script.
    * Supports strings and expressions
* log("log some output to the console & log file")
    * Supports expressions
* cast(\<someVar\>, type)
    * Casts a variable to a type
    * Valid types are: str, num, dict, list 
* // some comment
    * Inline comment
* /* some comment spanning multiple lines */
    * Block comment

#### Coming Soon
* {% if \<someCondition\> %}   \<someExecution\>
* {% if \<someCondition\> %}: \<someSetOfExecutionSpanningMultipleLines\> {% endif %}
* return \<someDataOrOptionallyNoData\>
    * Stops the processing of the current script and gives control back to the parent script
    * The parent script, if importing this subscript, will have access to any data returned by this subscript. The returned data will be directly under the subscripts namespace in the dataStore
        * For example: {"vars": {"someSubScript":{"return": "{"this is": "the returned data"}"}}}
* \<someVariable\> to \<type\>
    * Cast a variable to a type
    * Types: boolean, string, int, float, double, json, object
    * Type checking is not preformed and is expected of the user to know what they are trying to do
* {% for \<someNewVariable\> to range(\<someStart\>,\<someEnd\>) %} \<someExecution\>
* {% for \<someNewVariable\> to \<someEnd\> %} \<someExecution\>
* {% for \<someNewVariable\> in \<someExistingVariableObject\> %} \<someExecution\>
* {% for oneOfTheCasesListedAbove %}: \<someSetOfExecutionSpanningMultipleLines\> {% endfor %}
* require <someData>
    * Provide a means for a parent script to gather all of the data it will need to run from the executing user

#### Tidbits
* You can use arrays via dot notation
    * set someVar.1 = num1
    * set someVar.2 = num2
    * set someVar.{{counter}} = num3
    * When doing this, the first usage of a variable must either be someVar = "{}" or an index as part of that object. Failure to do this will result in errors being thrown.


### Commandtax - Data Gathering, Manipulating, Usage

#### Existing
* script \<pathToSomeScript\>
    * Executes the script file specified
* custom \<someCustomCommand\>
    * Execute some custom command
		

#### Coming Soon
* shell \<someCommand\>
    * Runs the command in the shell and returns the response from the shell
